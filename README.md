# Machine-Learning-Supervised-Models-
This repo contains a bunch of supervised learning models I have worked with. There are three regression models and then 5 classification models. I mainly used skicit learn for my models. This can be helpful for a lot of people.

# Regression Models (Supervised):
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

# Classification Models (Supervised):
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- KNN (K nearest neighbors)
- SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
- Naive Bayes
